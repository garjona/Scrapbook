                <p>Luke Skywalker has vanished.
                    In his absence, the sinister
                    FIRST ORDER has risen
                    from the ashes of the Empire
                    and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi,
                    has been destroyed.

                    brother Luke and gain his
                    help in restoring peace and
                    justice to the galaxy.

                    Leia has sent her most daring
                    pilot on a secret mission
                    to Jakku, where an old ally
                    has discovered a clue to
                    Luke’s whereabouts . . . .</p>

This separatist movement, under the leadership of the mysterious Count Dooku, has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy. Senator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to the Galactic Senate to vote on the critical issue of creating an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC to assist the overwhelmed Jedi...."
